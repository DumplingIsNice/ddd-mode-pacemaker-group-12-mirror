# TestRig for Pacemaker

c++ code writing closely as c syntax used to test the compiled c files of the SCChart model.

`main.cpp` program prints logged parameters of I/O and timer count to terminal. Transferred to excel for visualization.

## Dependencies
Requires cmake and g++ to build. Instructions to acquire those should be similar to the instruction Aron gave in the example github repo for the hostcodes.
