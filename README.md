# CS303-Assignment-1-Group12

In this project we design and perform simple validation on a DDD mode pacemaker model designed for use on embedded cyber-physical reactive systems. The design is implemented in a sequentially constructed approach to concurrency, using the KIELER SCCharts framework. The code is adapted to interface with Altera Nios II hardware for emulation. This report details the design decisions taken, significant challenges faced, avenues for future work, and a general overview of our project.
